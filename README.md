XScreensaver-RFID-Unlock
========================

This is a working proof of concept written in Perl that will allow one to unlock their XScreensaver with an RFID card. Put an RFID card in your cellphone case or on a keychain and hide the reader under your desk. When you return, the program will type your password and unlock the screensaver. Touted as "cute" and not the correct way to do things by the XScreensaver author himself, use this at your own risk. For my use at work to literally just keep coworkers from sending out "free hugs" emails from my account when I step away from my computer, this works just fine.
